# Tech Stack Used
---------Front end---------
1. React - vite
2. Redux and Reduxjs@toolkit
3. Tailwind UI + flowbite
-------- Backend ----------
1. DummyJSON Api for backend to fetch products Link : (https://dummyjson.com/docs/products)

I have used react-redux at frontend to handle the state of the whole application. This assignment contains all the functionalities asked in the assignment
along with user authentication as an addon. Although user authentication is not done with the backend since the api doesnt provide this functionality but for
developer purpose i have provided the way to connect it to backend. All the comments related to this is written in the code.

For Scalability purpose and maintainence purpose, all the required comments have been provided and redux is used considering the scalability.
